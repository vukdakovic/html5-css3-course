Flat design
-New type of design popularized by Apple - everything is without a shadow, without gradient or complex design or images


Typography

-Second heading should be about 30px to 40px
-Line spacing should be between 120% and 150% of the font size
-We should have between 45 and 90 characters per line of text
-Use good fonts - sans-serif for instance is more natural, clean, simple, modern
  -Other good ones are Open Sans, Lato, Raleway, Monsterrat, PT Sans
